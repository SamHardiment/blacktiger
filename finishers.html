            Also known as a Niagara Driver, Splash Mountain, or Black Tiger
            Bomb, this powerbomb is similar to the Crucifix Powerbomb, but
            instead of the wrestler falling forward to drop the opponent, the
            attacking wrestler falls to a seated position for a pinfall attempt
            instead of releasing the opponent. Innovated by Kyoko Inoue and
            popularized by Black Tiger. A top rope version was used by Konnan as
            well. It is used by Roman Reigns as a signature move.

            The Undertaker performs the Tombstone Piledriver Often referred to
            as a Tombstone piledriver. The wrestler first stands facing an
            opponent and places their stronger arm between the opponent's legs
            and their weaker arm on the opponent's opposite shoulder. The
            wrestler then lifts the opponent onto their stronger shoulder,
            turning them upside-down, similar to a scoop slam lift. The opponent
            is then lowered while being held so that the opponent's head is
            hanging between the standing wrestler's knees. The wrestler then
            falls or jumps to their knees, driving the opponent's head into the
            mat

          <li><strong>Tiger suplex</strong></li>
          <li>
            Innovated by Alfonso Dantés and popularized by the original Tiger
            Mask (Satoru Sayama), this move sees the wrestler standing behind
            their opponent, hooks both of the opponent's arms from the sides,
            and places their hands palm down flat against the opponent's upper
            back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards,
            arching their back and legs and then slamming the opponent down to
            the mat shoulder and neck first. Like other suplex variations, this
            move can either end in a bridging pin or be released upon execution.
